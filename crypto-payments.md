- User-friendly for non-crypto natives

**Core Capabilities:**

*Unified Authentication:*
- Social logins (Twitter, Google, Email)
- External wallet connections
- Single sign-on across all methods
- Automatic wallet creation

*Multi-Chain Wallet Management:*
- One login creates both EVM wallet (Base, Ethereum) and Solana wallet
- Automatic chain switching
- Secure key management by Privy
- Recovery via social login (no seed phrases)

*Transaction Signing:*
- Same approval modal regardless of chain
- Frontend prepares transaction, Privy signs
- User never sees private keys

**Integration Steps:**

*Frontend:*
- Remove WagmiConnectProvider and SolanaProvider
- Install @privy-io/react-auth
- Create PrivyProvider wrapper
- Update wallet components to use Privy hooks
- Add chain/token selectors for payment flow

*Backend:*
