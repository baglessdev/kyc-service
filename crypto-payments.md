## Requirements

### 1. Privy Integration

#### Description
Privy is a wallet-as-a-service platform that provides embedded wallets and seamless authentication for Web3 applications. We will integrate Privy to replace the current fragmented wallet connection system (RainbowKit + Wagmi for EVM, Solana Wallet Adapter) with a unified, user-friendly solution that enables multi-chain crypto payments.

#### Why Privy?
- **Best multi-chain support**: Native support for both EVM chains (Base, Ethereum) and Solana in a single SDK
- **Embedded wallets**: Users can create wallets without installing MetaMask, Phantom, or other browser extensions
- **Social login integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Twitter OAuth authentication
- **Mature SDK**: Production-ready with robust documentation and support
- **User experience focus**: Designed for non-crypto natives with progressive disclosure of Web3 complexity

#### Core Capabilities

**1. Unified Authentication**
Privy consolidates authentication across Web2 and Web3:
- Social logins (Twitter, Google, Email) that Token Forum already uses
- External wallet connections (MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect)
- Single sign-on experience across all methods
- Automatic wallet creation for social login users

**2. Multi-Chain Wallet Management**
When a user authenticates via Privy (e.g., Twitter login):
- **EVM Wallet Created**: Generates an Ethereum-compatible address (0x...)
  - Works on Base, Ethereum, Sepolia
  - Single address for all EVM-compatible chains
  - Uses same private key, different chain contexts
- **Solana Wallet Created**: Generates a separate Solana address (base58 format)
  - Independent from EVM wallet
  - Optimized for Solana's account model
- **Key Management**: Private keys encrypted and stored securely by Privy
  - User never sees or manages seed phrases
  - Recovery via social login credentials
  - No MetaMask or hardware wallet required

**3. Transaction Signing**
Privy handles signing for multi-chain payments:
- **EVM Transaction Signing**:
  - User approves payment on Base → Privy signs with EVM wallet
  - User approves payment on Ethereum → Same wallet, different chain
  - Automatic chain switching (Base ↔ Ethereum)
- **Solana Transaction Signing**:
  - User approves payment on Solana → Privy signs with Solana wallet
  - Native Solana transaction format
  - No bridge or conversion needed
- **Unified UX**: Same approval modal regardless of chain

**4. External Wallet Support**
Privy supports existing user-owned wallets in addition to embedded wallets:
- **EVM Wallets**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect (300+ wallets)
- **Solana Wallets**: Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, any Solana-compatible wallet
- **User Flexibility**: Users can connect both embedded AND external wallets to same account
- **Wallet Selection**: At payment time, user chooses which wallet to use for transaction
- **Self-Custody**: External wallet users maintain full control of their private keys

#### How Privy Enables Multi-Chain Payments

**The Problem Without Privy:**
```
User wants to pay on Base:
  → Must have MetaMask installed
  → Must create/import wallet with seed phrase
  → Must add Base network manually
  → Must fund wallet with ETH for gas

User wants to pay on Solana:
  → Must ALSO have Phantom installed
  → Must create DIFFERENT wallet with different seed phrase
  → Must manage two sets of credentials
  → Confusing and error-prone
```

**The Solution With Privy:**
```
User logs in with Twitter (once):
  → Privy automatically creates:
     - EVM wallet: 0xABC123... (works on Base, Ethereum, Sepolia)
     - Solana wallet: 8XyZ9a... (works on Solana)
  → User stored in database:
     UserWallet { userId, address: "0xABC123", type: EVM }
     UserWallet { userId, address: "8XyZ9a", type: SOLANA }

User wants to pay on Base:
  → Frontend uses Privy's EVM wallet
  → Privy switches to Base chain (chain ID 8453)
  → User approves → Privy signs → Transaction sent to Base

User wants to pay on Solana:
  → Frontend uses Privy's Solana wallet
  → No chain switching needed
  → User approves → Privy signs → Transaction sent to Solana

All with ONE login, ZERO seed phrases, ZERO wallet installations
```

#### Integration Architecture

**Frontend Layer (token-forum-frontend):**
```
Current State:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WagmiConnectProvider               │

    To: 0x742d...f44e
    Gas: ~$0.01"
6. User approves
7. Privy signs transaction with EVM wallet private key
8. Transaction broadcast to Base RPC
9. Transaction hash returned: 0x8f3c...
10. Frontend sends hash to backend for monitoring
```

**Scenario B: User pays on Solana (same user, different chain)**
```
1. User selects: Solana chain + USDC token
2. Backend generates quote: 29.99 USDC
3. Frontend prepares Solana transaction:
   - Get Privy's Solana wallet
   - Prepare SPL token transfer instruction
4. User clicks "Confirm & Pay"
5. Privy modal appears:
   "Approve transaction on Solana?
    Send: 29.99 USDC
    To: 8Xy...Z9a
    Fee: ~$0.0001"
6. User approves
7. Privy signs transaction with Solana wallet private key
8. Transaction broadcast to Solana RPC

**Option B: Dual Model System**
- Keep `StripePayment` table, add new `CryptoPayment` table
- Link both to subscriptions via union
- Pros: No migration needed, simpler initial implementation
- Cons: More complex queries, data in two places

**Recommendation: Option B initially, migrate to Option A later**

#### What Needs to Be Done

**Database Changes:**
- Add `PaymentMethod` enum (CRYPTO, STRIPE)
- Create `CryptoPayment` model with required fields
- Add payment method preference to User model (optional)

**Backend Changes:**
- Extend subscription controller to accept payment method parameter
- Create new payment router/controller for crypto payments
- Update checkout endpoint to route based on payment method
- Maintain existing Stripe integration unchanged
- Create unified payment history endpoint combining both types

**Frontend Changes:**
- Create payment method selection component
- Update checkout flow to show crypto vs card choice
- Add UI toggle in payment screens
- Update payment history to show both types
- Add payment method icons and styling

**Business Logic:**
- Ensure both payment methods grant identical access
- Implement payment method preference storage
- Add analytics to track payment method usage
- Create admin dashboard showing split between crypto/fiat

- **Multi-Wallet Strategy**: Support different wallet types (hot wallets, cold storage, multisig)
- **Chain-Specific Routing**: Each blockchain has its own receiving infrastructure
- **Vault Integration**: Optional integration with smart contract vaults for enhanced security
- **Automated Reconciliation**: Backend tracks which payments went to which wallets

#### Implementation Options

**Option A: Single Treasury per Chain**
- One receiving address per chain
- Simplest to implement and manage
- Best for: Initial launch, smaller volume
- Risk: Single point of concentration

**Option B: Multi-Wallet with Load Balancing**
- Multiple addresses per chain
- Rotate receiving addresses
- Best for: High volume, security conscious
- Complexity: Requires rotation logic

**Option C: Smart Contract Vault (RECOMMENDED)**
- Payments go to smart contract
- Auto-forwards to configured recipients
- Best for: Maximum transparency and automation
- Complexity: Requires smart contract deployment

**Recommendation: Start with Option A, evolve to Option C**

---

#### Detailed Implementation: Smart Contract Vault

**Overview:**
Smart Contract Vaults provide an on-chain, trustless solution for receiving and managing crypto payments. Instead of directing payments to traditional externally-owned accounts (EOAs), payments are routed to smart contracts that automatically handle fund management, routing, and distribution according to pre-programmed rules. This approach offers maximum transparency, auditability, and automation while removing single points of trust.

**Core Concept:**
When a user makes a payment, they send cryptocurrency directly to a smart contract address rather than a regular wallet address. The smart contract is programmed with business logic that determines:
1. Where funds should be stored
2. Who has access to withdraw funds
3. What conditions must be met for withdrawals
4. Optional automatic forwarding rules

**Architecture Components:**

**1. Payment Vault Contract (per chain)**
```
Primary responsibilities:
- Receive incoming payments from users
- Emit events for backend monitoring
- Store funds temporarily or permanently
- Execute withdrawals based on permissions
- Track payment metadata on-chain
- Support multi-signature withdrawals
```

**2. Payment Splitter Contract (optional, per project)**
```
Responsibilities:
- Automatically split incoming payments to multiple recipients
- Configurable split percentages
- Immediate or batched distribution
- Gas-efficient bulk transfers
- Immutable audit trail
```

**3. Treasury Contract (multi-chain)**
```
Responsibilities:
- Long-term storage of platform funds
- Multi-signature requirement for withdrawals
- Time-locks for large withdrawals
- Role-based access control (admin, treasurer, operator)
- Integration with governance (future DAO)
```

Gas Costs:
- User payment: ~80,000-150,000 gas (depends on recipient count)
- Split to 3 recipients: ~100,000 gas (~$0.03 on Base)
- Split to 5 recipients: ~140,000 gas (~$0.04 on Base)
```

**Type 4: Time-Locked Treasury Vault**
```
Purpose: Secure long-term storage with withdrawal restrictions

Key Features:
- Multi-signature requirement (e.g., 3 of 5 signers)
- Time-lock on withdrawals (e.g., 48-hour delay)
- Maximum withdrawal limits per period
- Role-based permissions (proposer, approver, executor)
- Emergency recovery mechanisms
- Upgrade capability via proxy pattern

When to Use:
- Main treasury storage
- High-value fund management
- DAO-controlled funds
- Long-term reserves

Gas Costs:
- Deposit: ~50,000 gas
- Withdrawal proposal: ~80,000 gas
- Withdrawal execution: ~120,000 gas
- Higher security = higher gas costs
```

- Explain benefits of vault system

**Gas Cost Communication:**
- Show total transaction cost including gas
- Compare costs: Simple wallet vs Vault vs Splitter vault
- Recommend optimal vault type based on payment size
- Display gas price and estimate

**Transaction Data:**
- Frontend automatically includes quoteId in transaction
- For EVM: Encode quoteId in transaction data field
- For Solana: Include quoteId in memo field
- Users don't need to understand technical details

**Confirmation & Receipts:**
- Show transaction hash
- Link to transaction on blockchain explorer
- Display event emissions from contract
- Show smart contract verification
