## Overview

### Project Context
Token Forum is a cryptocurrency/blockchain platform that combines AI-powered chat capabilities, Twitter integration, and token portfolio management. Currently, the platform uses Stripe for payment processing. This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive crypto payment system.

### Goals

- Support multiple blockchain networks (Base, Solana, Ethereum)
- Maintain Stripe as a secondary/fallback option
- Implement automated payment routing and profit distribution
- Provide complete payment tracking and reconciliation

### Success Metrics
- 70%+ of new subscriptions use crypto payments
- Payment confirmation time under 3 minutes
- Zero payment discrepancies in reconciliation
- Support for 3+ blockchains and 5+ tokens

---

## Requirements

### 1. Privy Integration (or Similar: Dynamic, Magic)

#### Description
Replace or augment the current wallet connection system (RainbowKit + Wagmi for EVM, Solana Wallet Adapter) with Privy to provide a unified, user-friendly authentication and wallet management experience.

#### Key Features
- **Embedded Wallets**: Users can create wallets without installing browser extensions
- **Social Login**: Wallet creation via Twitter/Google/email (complements existing Twitter OAuth)
- **Multi-chain Support**: Single interface for both EVM (Base, Ethereum, Sepolia) and Solana chains
- **Seamless Onboarding**: Reduce friction for non-crypto users while maintaining support for external wallets

#### Implementation Options

**Option A: Privy (Recommended)**
- Pros: Best multi-chain support, embedded wallets, social login, mature SDK
- Cons: Monthly fee based on active users
- Best for: Production deployment with focus on UX

**Option B: Dynamic**
- Pros: Similar feature set to Privy, competitive pricing
- Cons: Slightly less mature ecosystem
- Best for: Alternative if Privy pricing is concern

**Option C: Magic**
- Pros: Email-based authentication, simpler implementation

**Option B: Dual Model System**
- Keep `StripePayment` table, add new `CryptoPayment` table
- Link both to subscriptions via union
- Pros: No migration needed, simpler initial implementation
- Cons: More complex queries, data in two places

**Recommendation: Option B initially, migrate to Option A later**

#### What Needs to Be Done

**Database Changes:**
- Add `PaymentMethod` enum (CRYPTO, STRIPE)
- Create `CryptoPayment` model with required fields
- Add payment method preference to User model (optional)

**Backend Changes:**

- Wrong network → Prompt network switching

#### Monitoring Issues
- RPC provider down → Fallback to secondary provider
- Transaction not found → Continue polling with exponential backoff
- Missed confirmations → Reconciliation catches it

#### Amount Discrepancies
- Underpayment → Flag for manual review, contact user
- Overpayment → Credit to user account or refund
- Wrong token → Manual resolution required

#### Distribution Failures
- Transaction fails → Retry with exponential backoff
- Insufficient balance in source → Alert administrators
- Wallet address invalid → Prevent at configuration time

---

### Performance Optimization

#### Database
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for payment history
- Caching for active payment routes
- Archive old payments to separate table

#### RPC Calls
- Cache blockchain data where appropriate
- Batch RPC requests when possible
- Implement request rate limiting
- Use websockets for real-time updates (optional)

#### Frontend
- Lazy loading for payment history
- Optimistic UI updates
- Debounce price quote requests
- Cache token balances with short TTL

---

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Metrics to Track
- Payment success rate by chain
- Average confirmation time
- Failed transaction rate
- Distribution execution success rate
- RPC provider uptime and latency

#### Alerts
- Payment stuck in pending > 10 minutes
- Reconciliation discrepancies detected
- Distribution failure rate > threshold
